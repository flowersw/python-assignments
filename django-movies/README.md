# Django Movie Ratings

## Description

Create an interface in Django to the [MovieLens dataset][movielens].

## Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Create a new Django application
* Translate real-world data to Django models
* Explain what a database is
* Explain what a model is
* Use the Django admin
* Structure the Django admin to reflect your data

## Details

### Deliverables

* A Git repo called django-movies containing at least:
  * a `requirements.txt` file
  * a `README.md` file
  * a Django project called `movieratings`

## Normal Mode

Choose a dataset from the [MovieLens dataset options][movielens] and read its
README.

Create a new Django application in the `movieratings` project to hold your
models.

Create Django models for users (call the model `Rater` so as not to
confuse it with Django users), movies, and ratings. Make sure that your models
can contain the data from your dataset.

Create Django admin pages for your models.

## Hard Mode

Start adding methods to your models that you will need later. For `movie`,
you'll want the average rating for each movie, and the ability to get the
top movies by rating.

For `rater`, you'll want the average rating that rater gave to a movie, and
the ability to get the top movies that rater has not seen. You will also want
to be able to find the Euclidean distance between that rater and another using
their movie ratings. (See [our command-line version of this](https://github.com/tiyd-python-2015-05/movie-recommendations)
to see more.)

In order to do this, you'll want to [read up on the model layer of Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/#the-model-layer).

Try to test these new methods. Read [Testing in Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/testing/)
and then either look at [django-nose](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-nose) or [pytest-django](https://pytest-django.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
